## Reporting Bugs: Squash Those Pesky Critters!
1.  **Check Existing Issues**: Before reporting a new bug, make sure that someone else hasn't already slayed that beast! Check if the issue has already been reported on our issue tracker.
2.  **Create a New Issue**: If the bug is new, create a new issue and include:
    *   A clear description of the bug, like you’re telling a story.
    *   Steps to reproduce it, like instructions to complete a level.
    *   Any error messages, like clues that will lead us to the bug's lair.
    *  A descriptive title, using the affected nodes name.

## Suggesting Features: Share Your Ideas for New Power-Ups!

1.  **Check Existing Suggestions**: See if your idea has already been proposed in the list of issues.
2.  **Create a New Issue**: If it's a new idea, create a new issue with a descriptive title and:
    *   A description of the feature, explaining what it does.
    *   Explain *why* it would be useful, and how it would improve gameplay.

## Submitting Code: Become a Code Champion!

1.  **Fork the Repository**:  This is like creating your own copy of the game world.
2.  **Create a Branch**: Make your changes in a new branch. It's like creating your own save game to experiment.
3.  **Submit a Pull Request**:  Describe your changes and provide all steps needed to test and implement them, and also make a reference to the bug that you are trying to fix or the feature you implemented.

## Code Guidelines: Level Up Your Coding Skills!
*   **Follow the Existing Style**: Keep your code neat, clean and easy to read.
*   **Comment Your Code**: Explain why your code does something, not just what it does.
*   **Test Thoroughly**: Always verify your code before submit it and make sure it works as you intended.
*  **Code Format:** Make sure to follow the same code style conventions used for the project, use clear and concise naming for all the variables.
* **Use a Linter:** if you are planning to contribute code please use a tool such as `pylint` or `eslint` to ensure that your code is correctly formatted before submitting.
