"""
Force of Will Suite Light - Base Weight Node

This is the base class for all weight-related nodes in the Force of Will (FoW) Suite Light tier, like the foundation of your guild‚Äôs strength boosters in ComfyUI. It provides common functionality for applying weights to conditioning inputs, enhancing raw prompts for beginners with simple adjustments (no sliders or customization in Light‚Äîupgrade to Pro (‚Ç¨25) or Ultimate (‚Ç¨100) for advanced weighting). It‚Äôs your starting armor for weights like `SubjectWeight` or `StyleWeight` in `FoW_Suite_LIGHT`.
