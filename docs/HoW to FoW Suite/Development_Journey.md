# Development Journey: My Epic Quest with Force of Will Suite

Welcome to the behind-the-scenes story of building `FoW_Suite_LIGHT`, especially `PromptRefinerLight`! It‚Äôs like sharing my character‚Äôs epic quest through the coding dungeon‚Äîfull of challenges, victories, and lessons for ComfyUI. üöÄüéÆ

## 1. The Beginning: Why `FoW_Suite_LIGHT`?
- **Goal**: I wanted to create a newbie-friendly node suite for ComfyUI to simplify prompt creation for low-spec users and enable collaboration with high-spec users.
- **Inspiration**: The ‚ÄúForce of Will‚Äù (FoW) vision grew from helping beginners refine prompts, starting with a light version focused on raw prompts, predefined libraries, and no customized tokens.

## 2. Challenges Along the Way
- **Tokenization vs. Simplicity**: Initially, I included tokenization, but it confused newbies. I stripped it for `FoW_Suite_LIGHT`, focusing on raw prompts with predefined libraries for agents/villains.
- **File I/O Struggles**: Loading/saving `.txt` files for cross-platform use was tricky‚Äîensuring newline-separated Positive/Negative prompts required careful parsing.
- **UI Design**: Balancing drag, resize, collapse, and newbie guidance (e.g., alerts, tooltips) took time, but I settled on a dark theme with green/red accents for fun.
- **Git Setup**: Setting up Git for `FoW_Suite_LIGHT` on GitHub (`https://github.com/SirWillance/FoW_Suite_LIGHT`) was a puzzle‚Äîresolving ‚Äúunrelated histories‚Äù errors taught me version control basics.
- **ComfyUI Manager Integration**: Registering `FoW_Suite_LIGHT` with ComfyUI Manager (`custom-node-list.json` PR) was new, but it‚Äôs now pullable via ‚ÄúInstall Custom Nodes‚Äù for users.

## 3. Victories and Lessons
- **Light Version Success**: Finalizing `FoW_Suite_LIGHT` as a simple, stable suite with `PromptRefinerLight` was a win‚Äîusers can enter prompts, save/load files, and use predefined libraries easily.
- **Community Feedback**: Testing with newbies showed alerts were helpful but overwhelming, leading to the ‚ÄúShow Tips‚Äù toggle. Twitch followers helped refine `FoW_Suite_Standard` (‚Ç¨15) ideas.
- **Future Plans**: I plan to expand to `FoW_Suite_Standard` (‚Ç¨15, enhanced Light nodes), `FoW_Suite_Pro` (‚Ç¨25, `PromptRefinerPro` with customized tokens), and `FoW_Suite_Ultimate` (‚Ç¨100, premium), but `FoW_Suite_LIGHT` keeps it approachable.

## 4. Boosting Twitch with `FoW_Suite`
- **Twitch Affiliate Goal**: I‚Äôm streaming with `FoW_Suite_LIGHT` on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/sirwillance) to reach Affiliate status (50+ followers, 500+ minutes, 7+ days, 3+ viewers in 30 days). The first 50 followers get free `FoW_Suite_Standard` (‚Ç¨15) via [Discord](https://discord.gg/BHSxf8HB) to speed up my audience growth!
- **Pro Tip for Coders**: Like leveling up in a game, test small changes, debug with `console.log`, and comment your code (see [Gamers_Corner](Gamers_Corner.md)). Stream your ComfyUI workflows to help me and unlock guild perks for Pro/Ultimate features!
