## Reporting Bugs: Squash Those Pesky Critters!
1. **Check Existing Issues**: Before reporting, see if the bug’s already been squashed in our [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/SirWillance/FoW_Suite_LIGHT/issues).
2. **Create a New Issue**: If it’s new, create an issue with:
   - A clear description (e.g., “`PromptRefinerLight` modal freezes on save”).
   - Steps to reproduce (e.g., “Enter a prompt, click 💾, see UI lag”).
   - Any error messages from ComfyUI’s console or browser (e.g., `404`, JavaScript errors).
   - Use a descriptive title (e.g., “PromptRefinerLight: Save Button Freeze”).

## Suggesting Features: Share Your Ideas for New Power-Ups!
1. **Check Existing Suggestions**: Look for similar ideas in [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/SirWillance/FoW_Suite_LIGHT/issues).
2. **Create a New Issue**: If it’s new, propose it with:
   - A description (e.g., “Add drag-and-drop for prompts in `PromptRefinerPro`”).
   - Why it’s useful for ComfyUI users (e.g., “Improves prompt organization for pros”).
   - How it fits tiers (e.g., “For Pro/Ultimate with customized tokens”).

## Submitting Code: Become a Code Champion!
1. **Fork the Repository**: Clone your own copy of [FoW_Suite_LIGHT](https://github.com/SirWillance/FoW_Suite_LIGHT).
2. **Create a Branch**: Make changes in a new branch (e.g., `feature/prompt-refiner-drag-drop` for Pro).
3. **Submit a Pull Request**: Describe your changes, test steps, and reference the related issue (e.g., “Fixes #123, adds drag-and-drop to `PromptRefinerPro`”). Include:
   - Steps to test (e.g., “Enable tokenization, drag a prompt, verify order updates”).
   - Code changes in `backend/nodes/`, `frontend/`, or `docs/`.

## Code Guidelines: Level Up Your Coding Skills!
- **Follow the Existing Style**: Match Python (e.g., PEP 8) and JavaScript (e.g., Airbnb) conventions in `FoW_Suite_LIGHT`.
- **Comment Your Code**: Explain *why* (e.g., “Simplify `PromptRefinerLight` for newbies”)—see [Legends](Legends.md).
- **Test Thoroughly**: Verify changes in ComfyUI (e.g., test `PromptRefinerLight` modal, weights, file I/O).
- **Code Format**: Use clear, concise names (e.g., `promptText` for `PromptRefinerLight`).
- **Use a Linter**: For Python, use `pylint` or `flake8`:

  pip install pylint
  pylint backend/nodes/*.py

For JavaScript, use eslint:

npm install eslint -g
eslint frontend/*.js
Add .eslintrc.json and .pylintrc in the root for consistency.
