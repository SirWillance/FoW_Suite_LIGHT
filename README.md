# FoW_Suite_LIGHT

Welcome to the **FoW Suite**, a user-friendly node suite designed for beginners and experienced users alike! Whether you’re just starting out or already a coding wizard, this suite has something for everyone. Developing this suite took me 2 month without any prior knowledge of coding or what ComfyUI is capable of. If u encounter any severe bugs feel free to join in on my stream and tell me. You cals also read more about my Journey [here](https://github.com/SirWillance/FoW_Suite_LIGHT/blob/main/docs/HoW%20to%20FoW%20Suite/Development_Journey.md)

## What is FoW_Suite_LIGHT?
`FoW_Suite_LIGHT` is the beginner-friendly version of the "FoW" (Force Of Will) suite for ComfyUI, featuring `PromptRefinerLight` as the flagship node for simple prompt creation. It helps low-spec users craft raw prompts and collaborate with high-spec users for image generation, with a light, stable design—no tokenization or weighing, perfect for newbies! I developed it as my first coding project in 2 months, learning ComfyUI’s capabilities along the way.

The suite also includes supporting nodes for prompt refinement, weights, and agents/villains, all streamlined for ease of use. Future expansions like `PromptRefinerPro` will add advanced features, but `FoW_Suite_LIGHT` keeps it approachable and fun.

## Key Features

- **PromptRefinerLight**:
  - Enter Positive and Negative prompts in a draggable, resizable modal.
  - Save prompts as `.txt` files (e.g., newline-separated Positive/Negative) for cross-platform collaboration.
  - Clear, confirm, and collapse prompts with intuitive buttons (🧼, 💾, ✔).
  - Newbie-friendly UI with tooltips (e.g., “Clear All Prompts”) and optional tips (toggle “Show Tips”).
- **Supporting Nodes**: Streamlined nodes for prompt splitting, fusion, conditioning weights, and agent/villain roles (see [Nodes in FoW_Suite_LIGHT](#nodes-in-fow_suitelight)).
- **QoL Features**: Drag, resize, collapse for ease of use.
- **Beginner-Friendly**: Gaming-inspired tone, clear alerts, and defaults for beginners.
- **TextLoaderCombiner**: Load and combine text files with ease.
- **TokenSelector**: Select and manage tokens for your workflows.
- **UIClone**: Clone UI elements for faster prototyping.

## Workflows
Within this Repository u will find a couple of [Workflows](https://github.com/SirWillance/FoW_Suite_LIGHT/tree/main/data/Workflows) that will Guide you how to use the Suite efficiently. To get access to those [Workflows](https://github.com/SirWillance/FoW_Suite_LIGHT/tree/main/data/Workflows) you can whether manually download them here or look at the Directory of your Local ComfyUI Repository and find the FoW_Suite_LIGHT in your custom_node section. You are basically looking for "ComfyUI\custom_nodes\FoW_Suite_LIGHT\data\Workflows". You can now Drag and Drop it into your ComfiyUI interface or load it manually by looking for the top left of your interface, select "Workflow" then select "Open" and navigate to the directory. You sadly have to go threw this until im able to create a node that does this for you. 😅
