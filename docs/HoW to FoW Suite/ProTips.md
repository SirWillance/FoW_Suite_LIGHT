# Pro Tips: Level Up Your FoW Suite Skills

Here are some tips and tricks to help you get the most out of FoW Suite.

## 1. Use Relative Paths for Flexibility
Relative paths (e.g., `../../core/ui_core.js`) make your code more portable. They allow you to move files around without breaking imports.

## 2. Comment Your Code
Use comments to explain **why** your code does something, not just **what** it does. This makes it easier for others (and your future self) to understand your code.

## 3. Debug with `console.log`
Add `console.log` statements to trace the flow of your code and identify where things go wrong. For example:
```javascript
console.log("UIClone.js is being executed!");

## 4. Test Small Changes
When making changes, test them in small increments. This makes it easier to identify and fix issues.

## 5. Explore the Examples
Check out the Examples folder for ready-to-use code snippets. They’re a great way to learn and build on existing code.

## 6. Ask for Help
Don’t be afraid to ask for help! Whether it’s in the ComfyUI community or on forums, there’s always someone willing to lend a hand.

## 7. Have Fun
Coding is all about creativity and problem-solving. Don’t stress—experiment, break things, and learn along the way!
