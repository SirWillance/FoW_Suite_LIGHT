- **Example**: “I added a slider widget to adjust the weight of the conditioning input.”
- **Types of Widgets**:
  - **FLOAT (Slider)**: A slider for adjusting numeric values within a range.
  - **INT (Integer Input)**: A slider or input box for integer values.
  - **STRING (Text Input)**: A text box for entering text.
  - **COMBO (Dropdown)**: A dropdown menu for selecting from a list of options.
  - **BOOLEAN (Checkbox)**: A checkbox for toggling a True/False value.

## Display Options
- **Definition**: Settings that control how a widget is displayed in the user interface.
- **Example**: “I used the `display` key to show the weight slider as a numeric input box.”
- **Common Options**:
  - **`display`**: Controls the widget's appearance (e.g., `"slider"`, `"number"`, `"dropdown"`).
  - **`label`**: Provides a custom label for the widget.
  - **`tooltip`**: Adds a tooltip to provide additional information about the widget.

## Key
- **Definition**: In programming, a **key** is like a label or name used to identify a specific piece of data in a collection (such as a dictionary or JSON object). Think of it as a tag that helps you find what you’re looking for.
- **Example**: 
  - In the code `{"name": "Alice", "age": 30}`, `"name"` and `"age"` are keys.
  - In the context of widgets, the `display` key is used to specify how a widget should appear in the user interface.
- **Pro Tip**: If you hear someone say “key-value pair,” they’re talking about a label (key) and the data it points to (value). For example, in `{"color": "blue"}`, `"color"` is the key, and `"blue"` is the value.
